# DLS-Auth
Authentication and User Creation for Adstxt.plus


## Future Plans for Adstxt.plus Development
___

1. Move to Private Ethereum Network that MetaX intializes
   - We can then share `enode address` with any other parties that want to sync with our chaindata
   - Use Proof-of-Authority (Clique) consensus 
   
2. Move all gas transaction logic to a server that MetaX controls so that users do not have to worry about gas
   - Since this is private, tokens have no value outside
   
3. Populate our chain with as many reputable domains as possible (will bring about quicker adoption)

4. Ads.txt API will remain freely open to public

5. Integrate payment/subsciption model for website usage
   - Paypal will most likely be first candidate
